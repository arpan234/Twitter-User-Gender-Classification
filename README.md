# Twitter-User-Gender-Classification

Abstract
------------------
There can be a question in the mind of most of the people that “Can we disclose the gender identity of an individual just by reading their tweet?” This project is the answer to that question. 
In order to address answer for that question, a pattern needs to be find from the existing data of the male and female twitter users such as their tweets, profile description and their profile color. 
The twitter provides same sort of service to everyone. However, the way the male and female uses their twitter account is not identical. 
The project tries to research in that direction and find or predict the gender of the user behind any tweet.

Dataset
--------------------
The twitter dataset was downloaded from Kaggle website and it can be found under the following URL: https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-user-gender-classification .
The dataset has twenty thousand entries.

Goal
------------
The goal of the research project is to predict the gender of the user based on their fields. 
There is a pattern for most of the male and female tweeters that needed to be find. That pattern needed to be addressed. 
The goal of the final project was not to have an algorithm that can calculate or perform prediction with a 100% accuracy, but something with a better accuracy then a random guess can work.
Any individual that is an active twitter user or tweets, will use the same language or speech in their tweet that they use while speaking or engaging in conversation. 
If we can get a good accuracy in the project, then we can also apply this algorithm outside twitter and tweets and use it in real life to classify men and women from their speech or thoughts. 
Classifying in such a way can be proven useful in many ways.
